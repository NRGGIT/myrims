# HTML Multilinqual String

## Definition
One or several HTML strings, i.e. text enriched with HTML tags for the formatting purpose. Those HTML Strings are optionally qualified by distinct [Language Tags](../datatypes/Language_Tag.md).

## Notes
This type is a subtype of Multilingual String, which allows it to be used in case some data property value is stilized with HTML tags (i.e. description or title).   
The main intended usage of multiple HTML strings for different languages is to allow the representation of the abstract or some other data in different scripts and languages.
