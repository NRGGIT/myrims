# Local Resource ID Type

## Definition
The datatype that represents a local identifier. 

## Notes
If some restriction is needed for a specific local identifier for a resource, Local Resource ID Type should be specialized by defining regular expression
or any other restriction over String. An example of defining restriction over String can be found in the definition of [ISNI ID](../datatypes/ISNI_ID.md).  
An example of defining specification of a data type can be found in the relation between [Postal Address](../datatypes/Postal_Address.md) and
[Structured Physical Address](../datatypes/Structured_Physical_Address.md)

## Based on 
[String](../datatypes/String.md)
